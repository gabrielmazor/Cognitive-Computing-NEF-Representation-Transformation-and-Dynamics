# Cognitive-Computing-NEF-Representation-Transformation-and-Dynamics
This repository contains practice exercises using the Neural Engineering Framework (NEF), implemented in Nengo. 
These exercises were completed as part of my Cognitive Computing course, focusing on understanding the principles of neural representation, transformation, and dynamics within spiking neural networks (SNNs).
